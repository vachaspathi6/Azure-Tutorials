# Azure OpenAI - Powered by GPT-3.5-Turbo

This demo repository demonstrates how to create [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) infused chatbot with [Azure OpenAI Service (AOAI)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/overview)'s [GPT-3.5-Turbo](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/models#chatgpt-gpt-35-turbo-preview) model. I refer to my all-time favorite computer-animated comedy character, [Minions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minions_(Despicable_Me)) to build this Robotic Minion. By defining the system message to instruct how the model should behave and reference Minions-related information, such as Minions, [Despicable Me](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Despicable_Me), and [Universal Studios](https://www.universalstudios.com/), and make it got the brain of Minions.

I leveraged the [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) library/framework to build the [conversational UI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversational_user_interface) experience web app easily & rapidly.
